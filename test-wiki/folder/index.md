# Folder Index

This is the index page for the "folder" directory.

## Purpose

When you click on the "folder" item in the file tree, this page should display automatically because it's named `index.md`.

## Contents of This Folder

This folder contains:
- **index.md** - This page
- **Nested-Page.md** - [[Nested-Page|Another test page]]

## Folder Index Behavior

The folder index feature means:
- Clicking a folder in the tree expands/collapses it
- If the folder has an `index.md`, it displays automatically
- If there's no `index.md`, the current content stays displayed

## Navigation

- [[index|Back to root]] - Goes to root index.md
- [[Nested-Page]] - View the nested page
